        <h1>What Frontend development</h1>
        <p>The frontend is the digital representation of a company of an individual or an organisation. It is the bridge between a customer, product and service. it can also be seen as manifestation of someone's idea, so when there is small problems on the
            frontend or even spelling mistakes, it can have drastic implications for the brand. This is because the frontend is what allows user to use the website on content of the individual.</p>

        <h1>Why you chose this path</h1>
        <p>It is a path to improve myself and continue learning.</p>
